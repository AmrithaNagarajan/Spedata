# Spedata
A Telecom Service Provider web application.
Developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front-end and connected to MySQL using PHP.

Basically, a customer can create an account through the website and can use either of the three connections(prepaid, postpaid, broadband). A customer can also update profile, change his/her mode of connection and pay his/her bill. A customer can post a complaint or any queries regarding the services, it will be stored in the complain table and an employee who is free will be assigned to solve that complaint automatically. A customer can view all the complaints he/she has posted so far along with the details like status (pre-progress, on progress or solved) and the employee who is handling it. A customer can also remove his/her account. The employee changes the status of the complaint assigned to him/her from his/her page. So when one employee is done with one complaint, he/she is automatically assigned to another complaint. An employee can change his/her password as when an account is created for him/her by the admin, the password is just his/her employee ID. Admin is just one person, and only the admin can add an employee, update his/her details and remove him/her. Also, only the admin can add, update and delete plans in all the three tables. Moreover, admin can analyse the use of three modes of connection by the customers as a whole and can also analyse the use of plans in each mode separately.
